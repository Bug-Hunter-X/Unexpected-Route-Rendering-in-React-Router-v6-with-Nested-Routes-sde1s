This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router v6 related to unexpected route rendering when nested routes are used. The issue arises when navigating between parent routes, causing unexpected behavior in the nested route components.  The `UnexpectedRouteRendering.jsx` file showcases the buggy behavior, while `UnexpectedRouteRenderingSolution.jsx` presents the corrected implementation. The solution involves properly handling route rendering and navigation within nested structures. This issue is particularly relevant when dealing with complex routing hierarchies in React applications.
